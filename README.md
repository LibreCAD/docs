# docs

This is LibreCAD's documentation repository for multiple version and format documents, supported by readthedocs.io.

The documentation is created using a markup language called "reStructuredText" (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).  For those interested in contributing to the documentation, look to **LibreCAD-doc** on the LibreCAD forum (http://forum.librecad.org/).
