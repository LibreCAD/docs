Appearance
----------

LibreCAD's layout and appearance is highly configurable:

    #. **Menus** drop down from the menu bar or can be "torn off" and float anywhere on the display. Click the dashed line at the top of a menu to detach it.
    #. **Toolbars** can be dragged and dropped to the top, bottom, left, right, or float anywhere on the display.
    #. **Docks Widgets** (e.g. command line or layer list) can also be dragged and dropped to the top, bottom, left, right, or float within the drawing window.  In addition they can be stacked in the same region of the application window where they will be "tabbed".  Optionally docks can be placed outside of the application window, such as when using multiple monitors.  Drawing tools are also available as dock widgets, but are suited as floating "toolboxes".  Widgets can also be resized by dragging their edges.
    #. **Style sheets** allow users to change the visual elements of the application's window decorations; title bars, fonts, colours, etc. Refer to the :ref:`appendix <style-sheets>` for more details.

There are three categories on the "Appearence" tab that allows the user to change the look and behaviour of LibreCAD.

The "Graphic View" category has options for the cursor style and shape, scrollbars and grid.  The Anti-alias setting, if supported by the hardware, when checked will reduce jagged edgdes of diagonal lines, circles, etc.

The "Language" categories allows the the user to select the language used in the GUI and command line.  Supported languages can be found in the :ref:`appendix <appendix>`_.

Thirdly, the "Graphic Colors" section allow custom colors to be selected for the snap indicator, drawing background,  grid, and other indicators (selections, highlighted items and Handlles).  Users can select predefined colors from the drop down menu or select their own from the color selector.
