Layout
------

LibreCAD's layout and appearance is highly configurable:

    1. **Style sheets**
    2. **Menus** drop down from the menu bar or can be "torn off" and float with in the drawing. Custom menus can be created with menu items 
    3. **Toolbars** can be dragged and dropped to the top, bottom, left, right, or float within the drawing window.
    4. **Docks Widgets** (e.g. command line or layer list) can also be dragged and dropped to the top, bottom, left, right, or float within the drawing window.  In addition they can be stacked in the same region of the application window where they will be "tabbed".  Optionally docks can be outside of the application window, such as when using multiple monitors.  Drawing tools are also available as dock widgets, but are suited as floating "toolboxes". Widgets can also be resized by dragging their edges.
