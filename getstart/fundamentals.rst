Fundamentals
============

To be able to use LibreCAD effectively, there are a few concepts that need to be understood.  While drawings can be created with very little setup, as they become more complex further consideration to the elements of an entity is important.  This section offers an introduction to some concepts that are important to the creation of a drawing, but by no means is exhaustive.  The :ref:`Reference <reference>` section provides a description of the tools used to create and modify drawings.  General examples and guidence is offered in the :ref:`User Guide <guides>` section.


Entities
--------

An entity is a geometric shape; a line, circle, arc, etc.  A collection of entities form a drawing.

In addition to the basic information that describes the geometry of an entity, there are two more elements that further define an entity:

    - :ref:`Pens <pens>` describes the appearance of an entity, either on screen or in printed output with three additional properties:

        - Color
        - Width
        - Line Type

    - :ref:`Layers <layers>` provide a means to organize drawing and manage the properties of multiple entities.
    - *Pen* or *Layers* properties *can* have a specific meaning, but vary by industry or an organization's standards and a complete description is beyond the scope of this manual.
