Blocks
======

*Blocks* are reusable drawings of commonly used objects such as bolts, furniture, electronic components, title blocks, etc.  Inserted blocks, also called *instances* or *inserts*, are composed of geometric shapes (lines, arcs, etc.), but can also include text and dimensions.  Blocks can be created in the current drawing, inserted from the block library, or imported from a separate drawing file, Once inserted blocks can be used repeatedly within the drawing.

Working with Blocks
-------------------

There are two dock widgets for managing blocks.  The :ref:`Block List <widget-blockList>` dock for managing blocks *within the current drawing* and the :ref:`Library Browser <widget-libBrowser>` dock that displays a *collection of  blocks* in the library.  Both widgets allow users to insert blocks into the current drawing, but there are a couple of important differences:

   - Blocks inserted from the **Block List**:

      - A block can be placed at a different locations, scale, and/or rotation angle, and also be placed in an array.
      - Blocks inserted from the same block in the **Block List** is called an *instance*.  If a block is inserted from the same block multiple times all *instances* of the block are linked.  **Changes to one instance of the block will be reflected in all instances of that block.**

   - Blocks inserted from the **Library Browser**:

      - Each block can be placed at a different location, rotation angle and/or scale.
      - Blocks inserted multiple times will create a new instance of the block in the **Block List** each time it is inserted.  After the initial insertion, the blocks will numbered sequentially (e.g. *BlockName*, *BlockName-0*, *BlockName-1*, ...)  The inserted blocks will be independent of each other.

Blocks can also be imported from a separate file and will appear in the **Block List**.  Drawing files imported multiple times will create a new instances in the **Block List** and be numbered sequentially as with blocks inserted from the **Library Browser**. 


.. _ug-BlockList:

Using the Block List
--------------------

Creating a Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocks can be created in the current drawing for use within the drawing.  There are two ways to create a block:

   - From an existing object:

        #. Ensure the all entities for the object to be made into a block are on layer "0".
        #. Select all the entities that make up the object.
        #. Click on the **Create Block** icon |icon12|.
        #. Specify the reference point for the block.  The reference point is used to locate the object when it is inserted into the drawing.
        #. Provide a unique name for the new block and click **OK**.  The new block will appear in the **Block List**.
        #. The original object can be deleted from layer "0".  The new block remains available in the **Block List**.

   - From an empty block:

        #. Click on the **Add an empty block** icon |icon13|.  Provide a unique name for the new block and click **OK**.  The new empty block will appear in the **Block List**.
        #. Select the new block in the **Block List** and click the **Edit the active block in a separate window** icon |icon16|.
        #. Ensure layer "0" is selected and draw the object.  The drawing's origin (0, 0) will become the reference point for the block.
        #. Close the new block's drawing window and the new block will be saved.


.. important::

    Layer "0" has a special significance.  It is the default layer for new drawings.  More importantly in the context of blocks, it is equivalent to "no layer", similar in the way that *color "By Block"* is equal to "no specified color" or *line type "By Block"* is equal to "no specified line type".  **Generally layer "0" should only be used when creating blocks and should be the only layer in a drawing for a block.**

    Pay particular attention to the :ref:`Attributes <attributes>` when creating blocks.  In addition to the specific attributes, pen attributes (Color, Width, Line Type) also include "By Layer" and "By Block".

    - Blocks with specific attributes (e.g. color set to blue, width set to 0.18 mm, etc) will retain those attributes when inserted into a drawing.  The block needs to be edited to change any of the attributes.
    - Blocks with the attributes set to "By Layer" will adopt the attributes of the layer they are inserted in to.  The block's attributes will change if the layer's attributes are changed.
    - Blocks with the attributes set to "By Block" will initially adopt the attributes assigned to the layer.  The attributes can be changed with the **Attribute** tool.


Inserting Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocks can be inserted from the **Block List** or from the **Library Browser** (see :ref:`below <ug-LibBrowser>`).  When inserting a block from the **Block List**, the **Block List Tool Options** toolbar is displayed:

.. figure:: /images/toolOptions/toBlockInsert.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 75
    :alt: Block List insertion tool options
.. actual image size 617px x 34px

- Block can be rotated by the specified *Angle* and scaled by the *Factor*.
- A pattern of blocks can be created by specifying the number of columns and rows in the *Array* and *Spacing* between the columns and rows.

To insert a single block:

    #. Select a layer for the inserted blocks.
    #. Select a block in the **Block List**.
    #. Click on the **Insert the active block** icon |icon18|.
    #. Set the rotation angle in the *Angle* field and the scale factor in the *Factor* field as required.  (See :ref:`Angles <angles>` in **Fundamentals** and "Scale" in :ref:`Modify <tool-modify>` tools for more information.)  Note: Leave the *Array* values as "1" and *Spacing* values remain as "1.0".
    #. Place the block at the desired location within the drawing.
    #. Adjust the rotation angle and scale as needed and place additional copies of the block, or press [Esc] to exit the command.

Transformations (rotation, scale) and an array can be combined in a single block insertion.  The the scale and spacing is applied to the individual blocks within the array, however the rotation angle is applied to the entire array.

To insert an array of blocks:

    #. Select a layer for the inserted blocks.
    #. Select a block in the **Block List**.
    #. Click on the **Insert the active block** icon |icon18|.
    #. Set the rotation angle and scale factor as needed.
    #. Set the numbers of columns and rows in *Array* to create the required pattern.
    #. Set the *column spacing*. This is the distance between the insertion point of two blocks in adjacent columns.
    #. Set the *row spacing*. This is the distance between the insertion point of two blocks in adjacent rows. 
    #. Place the block at the desired location within the drawing. The insertion point of the array is the insertion point of the lower-left item in the array (at 0 degrees rotation).
    #. Adjust the options as needed and place additional copies of the block, or press [Esc] to exit the command.

.. note::

    When the Angle, Scale, Array size and Spacing are all applied to an array of blocks, the array is created as follows:

        - the scale, number of columns / rows and spacing is applied to the blocks in the array, and then
        - the entire array is rotated around the lower left corner of the array.
        - The blocks are rotated as the array is rotated and the spacing remains as defined even if the block entities are scaled.

    Using an array will treat all blocks in the array as a *single block instance*.  Selecting one entity of the array will select the all blocks in the array.  To keep instances separate, insert multiple instances from the block list or create additional copies with the "Move / Copy" tool or normal edit commands (cut, copy, paste).


Editing a Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    #. Select a block in the **Block List** and click the **Edit the active block in a separate window** icon |icon16|.
    #. Edit the block as necessary.
    #. Close the block's drawing window and the block will be saved and all instances of the block will be updated in the current drawing.


Saving Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocks can be saved to a separate file and used in other drawings or added to a user-defined library.  To save the block:

    #. Select a block in the **Block List**.
    #. Click the **Save the active block to a file** icon |icon17|.
    #. Select a file location, specify a file name and click **Save**.

.. admonition:: Recommendation

    When saving blocks to be added to the library it is recommended that the block's entities be placed on **layer "0"** and layer "0" is the *only layer* in the drawing.  Any additional layers in the block's drawing will be added to the new drawing when the block is inserted.  The additional layers may have unintended consequences.


.. _ug-LibBrowser:

Using the Library Browser
-------------------------

LibreCAD includes several categories of blocks in its own library; algorithm, elektro, plan/air_water, plan/architect, etc.  A user-defined library can also be configured in LibreCAD.


Inserting Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Recommendation

    When using blocks from the library, insert a *single insert* from the **Library Browser** and then insert subsequent *instances* from the **Block List**.  Inserting the block from the **Block List** retains the link between instances of the same block insert.  If a block is edited from the **Block List**, all instances of the block will show the changes.

    Only insert multiple *inserts* of a block from the **Library Browser** if they are to be independent.


To use blocks from the :ref:`Block Library <widget-libBrowser>`, select the block from the tree view and insert it in the drawing.  Blocks inserted from the library can be rotated and scaled through the **Library Browser Tool Option** toolbar:

.. figure:: /images/toolOptions/toBlockLib.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 75
    :alt: Library Browser insertion tool options
.. actual image size 317px x 33px

The rotation angle and the scale factor behave as they do for a block inserted from the **Block List**.

To insert a block:

    #. Select a layer for the inserted blocks.
    #. Select a block in the **Library Browser**.
    #. Click on the **Insert** button.
    #. Set the rotation angle and scale as needed. 
    #. Place the block at the desired location within the drawing.
    #. Adjust the options as needed and place additional copies of the block or press [Esc] to exit the command.


Adding a User-defined Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional parts and libraries can be added for blocks created by users, libraries downloaded from the LibreCAD wiki (https://wiki.librecad.org/index.php?title=Part_Libraries) or from other internet resources.  LibreCAD can be configured to show user-defined blocks in the library browser *in addition* to the blocks included with LibreCAD.  

The easiest method of installation, which does not require or Linux Root privileges or Windows Administrator access, is to create a new directory such as "Parts_Library" in the home directory or "Documents" folder.  The path to this directory would be something similar to "/home/*{Username}*/Parts_Library/" or "C:\\Users\\ *{Username}*\\Documents\\Parts_Library\\ ".  Blocks and libraries can then be placed under the parent "Parts_Library" directory.  The sub-directories will create categories that will appear in the tree view of the **Library Browser**.  

.. important::

    Do not place blocks directly in the parent directory of the  parts library.  Blocks must be  placed in sub-directories to the parent libraries directory to appear in the **Library Browser**.

To include the new blocks in the **Library Browser** tree view, edit LibreCAD's :ref:`Application Preferences <app-prefs>` to add the path to the directory or folder with the user-defined blocks.  From the menus, select **Options -> Application Preferences** and select the **Paths** tab.  Type the full path to the part library, e.g. /home/*{Username}*/PartsLibrary/ or C:\\Users\\ *{Username}*\\Documents\\PartsLibrary\\ , into the text-box labelled "Part Libraries" and click "OK".  Click the **Rebuild** button on the **Library Browser** dock and the new libraries will appear in the tree view.


Importing Blocks
----------------

Blocks can also be inserted from as a file from other sources.  With an open drawing:

    #. Select **File -> Import -> Block**.
    #. Locate and select the block drawing file and click "Open".
    #. Set the rotation angle and scale as needed. 
    #. Place the block at the desired location within the drawing.
    #. Adjust the options as needed and place additional copies of the block or press [Esc] to exit the command.

As with inserting a block from the **Library Browser**, importing a block multiple times will create a new instance of the block in the **Block List** each time it is imported, each with a sequentially numbered block name after the initial block insert.  When using blocks from external files the same layer criteria applies (i.e. layer "0", ...)


"Exploding" Blocks
------------------
 
.. figure:: /images/blockExploded.png
    :align: right
    :scale: 67
    :alt: Selected block entities

.. actual image size 415px x 200px

Once a block has been inserted into a drawing, it is treated a single entity and can only manipulated (moved, scaled, etc.) as a single entity.  Select any one entity within the block selects the entire block.  However, blocks can be disassembled, or *exploded*, and once exploded the individual entities making up the block can be edited.  To explode a block:

    #. Select a block.
    #. Click on the **Explode** icon |icon20|.

.. Force end of left / right text wrap
.. include:: /inclFiles/eoWrap.rst

.. note::

    Once a block has been exploded it is no longer a block and cannot be treated as a single entity.  If it is necessary to recreate the block, refer to **Creating a Block** above.
