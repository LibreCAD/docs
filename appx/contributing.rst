============

Code
----

If you are a developer, outstanding in C++, or a beginner we can use all the help.  With a bit of determination, the IRC channel, Zulip chat and the Libre-CAD-dev mailing list, we can help you get started and making progress.  The source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD).  A good starting point for developers is the LibreCAD Developer's wiki on GitHub (https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/wiki/Git-and-GitHub).

The :ref:`Online Resource <resources>` section provides links to further information on downloading and building LibreCAD.


Documentation
-------------

Developers are usually bad in making documentation, so if you like writing documentation your involvement in developing the **User Manual** would be greatly appreciated.

The documentation is hosted by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. The most recent version of LibreCAD's User Manual can be found at https://librecad.readthedocs.io/. As with the source code, the *documentation source* is hosted GitHub (https://github.com/LibreCAD/docs).  The documentation is created using a markup language called **reStructuredText** (Refer to http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).  For those interested in contributing to the documentation, refer to LibreCAD Documentation wiki on github (https://github.com/LibreCAD/docs/wiki).


Translation
-----------

Help localize LibreCAD, we currently support over 30 languages.  Our translation server is at https://translate.librecad.org/.  You can contribute to a language already started or or request the creation of a translation for a new language in the forum in the **LibreCAD-translate** section.
