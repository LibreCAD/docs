Contributing
============

Code
----

If you are a developer, outstanding in C++, or a beginner we can use all the help.  With a bit of determination, the IRC channel, Zulip chat and the Libre-CAD-dev mailing list, we can help you getting started and making progress.  The source code is hosted on GitHub: `https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD <https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD>`_.  The :ref:`Online Resource <resources>` section provides details on downloading and building LibreCAD.


Documentation
-------------

Developers are usually bad in making documentation, so if you like writing documentation, your involvement would be greatly appreciated.

The documentation is published on https://librecad.readthedocs.io/>`_. As with the source code, the documentation is hosted GitHub (`https://github.com/LibreCAD/docs <https://github.com/LibreCAD/docs>`_).  Anyone wishing to contribute can create a fork, and edit existing documents or create new chapters.  The documentation is created using a markup language called **reStructuredText** `<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.  For those interested in contributing to the documentation, look to **LibreCAD-doc** on the LibreCAD forum `http://forum.librecad.org/ <http://forum.librecad.org/>`_.


Translation
-----------

Help localize LibreCAD, we currently support over 30 languages.  Our translation server is `https://translate.librecad.org/ <https://translate.librecad.org/>`_.  You can complete new languages, or request creating translations for a new language in the forum.
