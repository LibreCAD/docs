    "Snap Middle", |icon07|, "sm", "Snap to the middle of a path. Enabling this mode displays a ''Middle points'' input. If you change the value to 2 then you can snap to the trisection points of a line segment."
    "Snap Distance", |icon08|, "sd", "If you snap to the endpoint of a line segment then activate ''snap distance'' and input 50, then it will snap to a point 50 units from the endpoint on the line segment. However, it will also snap to a point that is 50 units from the other endpoint."
    "Snap Intersection", |icon09|, "si", "Snap to the intersection of two entities. Note this does not currently work for polylines."
