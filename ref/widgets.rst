Dock Widgets
=============

Dock widgets serve two purposes; they provide alternative method to access several drawing tools, and additional tools (Block List, Command Line, Layer List, Library Browser, and Pen Wizard).

Dock widgets are available for these :ref:`drawing tools <tools>`: Circle, Curve, Dimension, Ellipse, Info, Line, Modify, and Polyline.

Docked widgets can be dragged to different areas by "grabbing" (click and drag) the title bar of the widget.  Widgets will snap into place when released in a dock area.  Widgets in the left, right, top or bottom areas can either be placed on top of existing widgets, creating tabs for each category of widget placed in that area, or place above or below the existing widget dividing the area in sections.  Dock widgets can also be resized by clicking on and dragging the edge of the widget's box to a minumum of five icons width and no shorter than the default height.
